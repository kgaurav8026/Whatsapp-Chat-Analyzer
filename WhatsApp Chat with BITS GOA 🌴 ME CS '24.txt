06/08/22, 11:19 - Chirag Bits: Okay .. if i was in your situation i would have chosen bits because of obvious reasons.. 1. Bits tag , 2. Campus life at goa , 3. Placements are better i would say when compared to DTU ISY also studying core cse will be better .

17/08/22, 13:13 - Shlok Bits: .
17/08/22, 13:13 - Shlok Bits: .
17/08/22, 13:13 - Divas Bits: Accha
17/08/22, 13:13 - Shlok Bits: Like preferring cpp over java, or py?
17/08/22, 13:14 - Shlok Bits: Compile time advantage over others ?
17/08/22, 13:16 - sreenath: Yup very less time and space consumption
17/08/22, 13:16 - Shlok Bits: Why space consumption is an issue?
17/08/22, 13:17 - sreenath: Usually in coding they will have test cases to check for both
17/08/22, 13:17 - Chirag Bits: Cpp is faster when compared to java or python.. also it is clean I'm used to it as we have extensively studied C but it is not like C and it must not be learnt in a way that we are going for cpp because we know C , start learning it from with the essence of object orientation..and yeah what more top reason to learn Cpp will be the STL .
17/08/22, 13:18 - Shlok Bits: Stl is available in one way or other for every language
17/08/22, 13:18 - Shlok Bits: But i can agree on the compile time factor for competitive coding
17/08/22, 13:18 - Shubham Pathak Bits: Compilation time difference is an issue to those who are into competitive coding, normal problem solving ke liye theek h teeno. But yeah, CPP>Java> python ( compile time )
17/08/22, 13:19 - Shlok Bits: After all placement time pe competitive coding hi kaam ayegi na
17/08/22, 13:19 - Deepak Bits: Python me software designing bhut bda sar dard h...CPP and JAVA are comparatively easier
17/08/22, 13:20 - Shubham Pathak Bits: Umm, I don't think so. Matlab kuch companies h jaha yes, like Google. Par for most of the companies
17/08/22, 13:20 - Shlok Bits: I was thinking about pursuing java properly
17/08/22, 13:20 - Shlok Bits: Since its like middle ground bw cpp and py

22/08/22, 14:14 - +91 96653 84633: Yes got it!
22/08/22, 14:14 - Ravi Bits: Got from a group
22/08/22, 14:14 - Shlok Bits: But it doesnt have migration or tc
22/08/22, 14:14 - Shlok Bits: This year? Or prev?
22/08/22, 14:14 - Manish Pandey Bits: <Media omitted>
22/08/22, 14:16 - Shlok Bits: But guys i would advise everyone to get either TC or Migration because lagta hai naye institute me jaate time as per my knowledge
22/08/22, 14:16 - +91 96653 84633: Yes
22/08/22, 14:20 - Shubham Pathak Bits: Yeh last year ka h na?
22/08/22, 14:20 - Ravi Bits: Yes
22/08/22, 14:22 - Ravi Bits: I have conduct certificate but I don't have migration certificate!  What should I do?
22/08/22, 14:22 - Sagar Bits: Same
22/08/22, 14:23 - Ravi Bits: Good student
22/08/22, 14:23 - Deepak Bits: I think conduct certi tells about only behaviour of student na?
22/08/22, 14:23 - Ravi Bits: What does transfere certificate speak about?
22/08/22, 14:24 - Ravi Bits: ✌
22/08/22, 14:24 - Deepak Bits: Migration and transfer refers that stu have completed the course and may pursue higher degree
22/08/22, 14:25 - Ravi Bits: Oh👍
22/08/22, 14:28 - Shubham Pathak Bits: Transfer is same as leaving right?
22/08/22, 14:32 - Madhu Bits: Yaa
22/08/22, 14:34 - Madhu Bits: They haven't mentioned to bring TC 
And here PPL will be from different places and to reach there to bring tc it'll take few days time. If tc is required then they would have mentioned already in the required documents
They have mentioned degree certificate and provisional degree certificate. What is this for ? 
I think this will be enough for them
22/08/22, 14:35 - Shlok Bits: My transfer certificate has conduct mentioned on it, if its the same for you then you can use it, if not, i’d say you have a week go to your college and ask for your migration/TC
22/08/22, 14:37 - Deepak Bits: Yaar apni grp ki DP to MIT,Massachusetts  jesi lg rhi h🥹
22/08/22, 14:37 - +91 91048 73463: It's safer to bring TC/ migration along with provisional and/or final degree certificate
And if you don't have any certificate they'll give you sometime to submit it later
So don't worry guys
22/08/22, 14:37 - Jalaj Bits: 😂😂
22/08/22, 14:37 - Shlok Bits: Yes they do allow this
22/08/22, 14:42 - Divas Bits: Migration certificate mai thoda delay ho sakta hai, to koi problem to nhi hogi? 
I might not be able to show the migration at the time of reporting but will definitely show it within 15 days.

But he was trying to convey that we guys have to study really hard and should be able to solve the problems. He said that read cormen and learn concepts and problem solving techniques. 
Also, he feels that the class participation is less. He wants us participate and ask questions/doubts in the class. Be it the wrong or the correct answer, but atleast he should know that we're able to understand what he is teaching. 
Hod Sir said talk to Bharat Sir.

02/10/22, 16:16 - Sandya Bits: I think it's because 802.11 ke packets capture karne ke liye 
1. The wifi should support 802.11 adapter
2. If it does support that, then we have to start the pcap in "monitor mode"
02/10/22, 16:17 - Sandya Bits: But not all the OS have this monitor mode

03/10/22, 13:19 - Ravi Bits: Q2.PiggyBank
You are given an Array of Piggybanks,<a[6,1,2,3]> if you break ith piggy bank you receive the sum a[i-1]*a[i]*a[i+1],If the i is going out of bounds u just get $1.
03/10/22, 13:20 - Ravi Bits: i.e.  if you break 0th piggy bank you get 1*6*2
03/10/22, 13:20 - Ravi Bits: the broken piggy bank is removed from the array of piggy banks
03/10/22, 13:21 - Ravi Bits: you have to proceed in such a way that you you receive maximum money...
03/10/22, 13:22 - Ravi Bits: Example
ENter the number of elements you want in the vector:4
6
1
3
2
Array[i]:1
Array[i-1]*Array[i]:6
Array[i-1]*Array[i]*Array[i+1]:18
Array[i]:2
Array[i-1]*Array[i]:6
Array[i]:3
Array[i-1]*Array[i]:18
Array[i]:6

MAximum money received = 48

Database 
Distributed Systems 
Software Engineering 

As these subjects will be helpful for us in placements, also these are pure HD courses with no BE students.

Any of u has any comments this??
16/11/22, 13:32 - Sandya Bits: Great idea✨✨
16/11/22, 13:33 - Sandya Bits: 1. Advanced database
2. Software architecture 
These two subjects you should pitch for in the mail

16/11/22, 22:59 - Pulkit Bits: There is high chance that software architecture will be taken by Rizwan ma'am, so we are thinking to pitch for the rest of 2 subjects. 
If any one of the student is keen to register (if provide a choice) for software architecture then will add that too in the mail. 
Kindly respond to this message till morning so that we can send the mail.

25/11/22, 21:03 - Sakshi Bits: Look Sir is giving more options to score marks in algorithms. For people who think they can score good marks in contest they are getting 4 contest for that. For people who think they can score good marks in mcqs let them have that. Atleast give a fair chance to score for everyone. There will be no negative marking in mcqs... Kuch ni b padhoge toh b thik hai.
25/11/22, 21:03 - Sakshi Bits: Best 3 out 5 options me kya problem h?
25/11/22, 21:06 - Ananya Bits: Guys are you okay with best 3 out of 5 options? (4 contests+1quiz)
25/11/22, 21:09 - Jehan Bits: This is not a thing suggested by sir himself, that was just an idea of Amey and sir has never declared anything like including mcq thing in best of 5
25/11/22, 21:10 - Sakshi Bits: Yes but he's fine with this option. He would include this.
25/11/22, 21:10 - Sakshi Bits: There is no enforcement to give that contest ... It will be optional.
25/11/22, 21:12 - Jehan Bits: He said so?
25/11/22, 21:12 - Sakshi Bits: Yess
25/11/22, 21:12 - Jehan Bits: Lol, everything is optional if we look it that way, but definitely everyone want to score
25/11/22, 21:13 - Sakshi Bits: This message was deleted
25/11/22, 21:13 - Jehan Bits: And why to increase extra burden with this new quiz thing as we already have many tasks and compre is there in one month
25/11/22, 21:15 - Sakshi Bits: Haan you're going to anyway study for compre na.. there is no negative marking. It is optional. If you want to give you can give otherwise don't give.
25/11/22, 21:16 - Shlok Bits: People who are good at theory are already getting mid sems and compre to score aur kitna score karna hai?

25/11/22, 21:18 - Shlok Bits: Doesnt matter, padhna toh theory hi haina
25/11/22, 21:19 - Shlok Bits: Why would i want to leave my marks to chance?

02/12/22, 15:55 - Shubham Pathak Bits: Hello everyone.

A lot of people came to me requesting to arrange Class Presentation slots for every student as they don’t want to miss out on marks. I had a talk with Shubhangi ma’am today, regarding the same. Here’s what ma’am has decided.

1. We have reserved 5 slots, 6th, 8th, 9th and 2 slots on 13th. 

2. In each slot, 8 students can participate ( almost covers all the remaining students ) and present for 5 mins

3. For now, interested students will list their names here. I will schedule them into slots, and mail details before every lecture. Don’t worry if your name isn’t in the first slot, eventually, you’ll get the opportunity.

4. Regarding topics, we’ll further discuss it with ma’am. The first option is ma’am will give the topics, the second being you can cover any previous topic under revision, but present it by yourself ( don’t read it from slides ), and the third being any other topic. In any case, the topics will need to be approved by ma’am.

02/12/22, 18:52 - Ravi Bits: Whats cancelled?
02/12/22, 19:00 - sreenath: Can this be cancelled? If everyone who got the 2 marks for OS class presentation are ready to reduce the 2 marks. Otherwise the entire class has to do the presentation
02/12/22, 19:06 - Tushar Bits: <Media omitted>
02/12/22, 19:08 - Ravi Bits: My dear relatives its relative grading.

02/12/22, 20:21 - Ankit BITS  220: Everyone is attending coz of this reason.
Sreenath proposed this for the benifit for the whole class even though he also got 2 marks
02/12/22, 20:22 - Ankit BITS  220: We are just giving our suggestions.No need for such comments
02/12/22, 20:30 - Madhu Bits: Bc I presented for half an HR man 😂 if everyone are getting it let them get. Let everyone present. Later let's discuss this 
If that 2 marks thing is removed then why will the PPL in that list will present now
02/12/22, 20:33 - Shubham Pathak Bits: It’s okay guys. Let’s not argue anymore. This is win-win for all 😄
02/12/22, 20:33 - Ankit BITS  220: That 2 marks thing has been added recently and we dont have many lectures.If she would have done it earlier then obviously everyone would have presented by now
02/12/22, 20:34 - Shubham Pathak Bits: Also those who don’t want to give presentation, its fine 😄 just make sure your name is not in the list
02/12/22, 20:35 - sreenath: Everyone come to A-mess at 11 pm
02/12/22, 20:36 - sreenath: Ice cream party
02/12/22, 20:37 - Madhu Bits: Oyeee... 2 marks thing added during 1st or 2nd week of September.   It's not added recently... 
In midsem PPL scored less and suddenly they started asking ma'am to give chance to present. 
*It's old thing not recently added*

04/12/22, 12:13 - Shlok Bits: Hello everyone,
I am sure you have met our beloved furries near C-mess,BITS GOA.Unfortunately,one of the puppies named Alpha is suffering from Parvo Virus and he was admitted in Tailwaggerz Pet Clinic in Madgaon,Goa at 1am. The remaining 4 puppies are also suspected to be infected with it.Survival cases are nearly zero if they are left untreated.But as Alpha is in his initial stages so survival chances are more than 80%.

Even a small amount of Rs.10,20,50,.... is also appreciated as it will eventually help us to repay our bills and bring our furry back.Please share this message this to all the groups that you are connected with helping us to reach out to more peoples.So please don't let humanity down and collectively support our furries.

05/12/22, 13:50 - Shubham Pathak Bits: Hello guys,

One final update regarding AOS class presentation. Maam told me 

“ Textbook topics covered either by me or the students will be part of the comprehensive exam “

So attending these lectures will help you atleast to some extent. Many students are going to discuss chapters 12 and 13 from the textbook, and ma’am is expecting students ( apart from presenters 😂 ) to attend these lectures.

Thank you :)✌️

21/03/23, 14:11 - Shlok Bits: SA ki class ke baad sabne discuss kiya tha ki manna ki class jaana ditch krenge to make him realise ki exam unfair tha and apna grading kharab hoga, also in an attempt to make things better we are thinking of talking to HOD sir about this unbalanced structure of exam and that suicide thing he mentioned to some students.
21/03/23, 14:13 - Shlok Bits: If anyone wants to go to ACA lectures despite this please upvote kardo ye msg ko so that sabko pata rahe kitne log kayenge kitne nahi jayenge class
21/03/23, 14:15 - Ravi Bits: POLL:
ACA class
OPTION: Will go to ACA (0 votes)
OPTION: Will not waste time (5 votes)

21/03/23, 14:31 - Madhu Bits: First to inform HOD then decide based on the response ryt 
(Just a suggestion)
Instead of suddenly not gng to class 

He might get triggered
21/03/23, 14:34 - Tarun Bits: What if manna get triggered and start the grading from b - and as of previous cases hod will only support the faculties only
21/03/23, 14:34 - Shlok Bits: Yes yes
21/03/23, 14:35 - Shlok Bits: First we’ll talk to hod only
21/03/23, 14:35 - Shlok Bits: Just wanted to know everyone’s opinion and also tell everyone that we are thinking about this
21/03/23, 14:36 - Shlok Bits: Bhai jis hisaab se marks aane wale hai mid sem me grading anyway A se start nahi hogi, as for about him getting triggered, what more can he do at this point?
21/03/23, 14:39 - Shlok Bits: My main point being, lab component me already verilog and asm is being evaluated, if mid sems and compre me bhi yehi pucha jayega toh whats the point of keeping classes and teaching theory.

21/03/23, 21:52 - Shubham Pathak Bits: Guys, just one thing. Manna sir might ( would probably ) inform  the HoD regarding the assignment fiasco, and we might as well lose support. So be very careful with your choice of words.
21/03/23, 21:53 - Shubham Pathak Bits: Let it be more of a plea from the students side that we want to score well , and less of a complaint.

21/03/23, 22:16 - Jehan Bits: Done
21/03/23, 22:18 - Jehan Bits: I think It should be a complaint, as all have attended his classes well and yet no remarkable weightage is from theory or what he taught in class... this is clear revenge.... he will do anything to try keeping our grades to start from 8
21/03/23, 22:30 - Shubham Pathak Bits: I understand. If possible, rather than complaining, resort to constructive criticism. Rather than saying manna sir doesn’t give questions or theory from the class materials, he does this, he does that….request Hod to ask Manna sir to keep the exams more aligned with what is being taught in the class.
21/03/23, 22:36 - Jehan Bits: Obv, we will discuss with sir and request for certain things and not complain...

06/04/23, 22:45 - Tushar2 Bits: I’m doing RP under *BIJU SIR* this sem. In my previous meeting with him this week, he asked me about the issue our batch is facing regarding ACA subject. So I told him about some of the issues which we are facing -

*1)* I told him about mid sem paper in which Kanchan sir asked verilog question of approx 30 marks out of 40 marks paper.
His reply - He said that a faculty cannot ask students to write code in theory exams whether it is mid sem or comprehensive exam. Even if u are asking the verilog question in theory exams then there should be a balance between theory and coding questions. 

*2)* Also told him about the suicide thing that and sir told that this very sensitive issue and is not expected from a faculty of bits and should be immediately informed to the hod, he will surely look into it.

*3)* I also told him about the assignment situation. I told him that we have not been taught verilog and MIPS and have to spend almost entire week to complete the assignment and what’s the point of coming to BITS if he is not teaching verilog & we have to study verilog entirely from online resources to complete the assignment.
He said that this is also a valid point and should be managed by the faculty. If u are not teaching verilog in the class then u cannot ask the student to do the verilog assignments.
If something  which u are not teaching in the class u cannot ask it in mid sem/ end sem exam. 

So, all of ur points are valid and u all should immediately contact HOD sir. He will surely look into this matter.
Even after this if ur issues are not resolved then u can also contact Bharat sir for the same.
06/04/23, 23:17 - sreenath: Sure
06/04/23, 23:18 - Shlok Bits: Let’s do this

31/05/23, 20:33 - Madhu Bits: If he says why so urgent then tell him they are asking to book tickets 
I don't know about others but for me it's difficult if they say like 20 days before the commencement
31/05/23, 20:47 - Sandya Bits: Going by last year's pattern, we can expect the placement to start in the first week of July at the earliest or second week at the latest. 

We have to prepare ourselves for the callback anytime after June (which is quite obvious but still just to keep ourselves on our toes)  

Regarding the official announcement for the same, it'll be made asap.
31/05/23, 20:57 - Madhu Bits: Did u ask mouli sir or this is your statement

07/07/23, 22:02 - Madhu Bits: Do we need to register @917388581331 for deloitte webinar
Is there anything regarding placements ?
07/07/23, 22:08 - Sandya Bits: It's a general webinar from Deloitte 
Not related to placements 
You can register if you want to attend it
07/07/23, 22:08 - Madhu Bits: Ok 👍🏻
09/07/23, 19:23 - Sandya Bits: Regarding the mock interviews, we (Placement Unit) associated with "Masai School", which conducted mock interviews of two of our own batchmates. This organization basically maps students to people working in SDE-1 and SDE-2 profiles of reputable companies like Microsoft, Amazon, Adobe etc, who take the interviews on a certain platform. Based on the positive response we got from the students and after negotiating the prices with Masai as best as we could, there’re two pricing models available now:

1.	1 mock interview with feedback costing around 1800/-
2.	2 mock interviews with feedback and considerable time in between the two for improvement scope costing around 2500/-
09/07/23, 19:24 - Sandya Bits: It is understandable that some of you might find the prices excessive but do consider the fact that these interviews will be of top quality and be a great help to your preparation.


If you are opting out of the mock interview because you are confident enough to crack the actual ones yourself, that’s great!


But if you are backing out of the interviews based on the price, then please remember that the current market conditions are not at all favourable and there's going to be a tough competition for the roles we all aspire especially with the undergraduates, who we all can agree are far more prepared. Keeping that in mind do take an informed decision about the same.
09/07/23, 19:24 - Sandya Bits: We are floating an interest form to share with the organization (Masai) and urge everyone to fill it up by **10th July(tomorrow) 11 AM**.
09/07/23, 19:25 - Sandya Bits: https://forms.gle/HhXsSRk56PQ5fvxKA

10/07/23, 21:36 - Shlok Bits: Hi @917388581331, aren’t we supposed to use the resume that has been created by superset for every interview within the campus?
10/07/23, 21:44 - Sandya Bits: Yes that's true.
10/07/23, 21:46 - Shlok Bits: Okay then since we will not be creating out own resumes, the resume reviewing which is included in the mock interviews, they will be reviewing superset generated resume?
10/07/23, 21:56 - Sandya Bits: Although reviewing the superset generated resume is important at this point because that is going to be used for every on-campus interview, one can also give resumes built in different format for reviewing in these mock interviews

26/07/23, 11:11 - Sandya Bits: 3. Follow the conventional dress code
26/07/23, 11:11 - Sandya Bits: 4. Make sure your laptops are fully charged, LT-4 might not have enough charging ports and also they might be in poor working conditions.

26/07/23, 11:22 - Sandya Bits: Invigilators will help you out
26/07/23, 13:24 - Ravi Bits: Dear students,
     There is a change of plans for the Qualcomm test. As some of the students are not on campus it will be a remotely proctored test that you will have to give from your own rooms. There is no need to report to LT3, LT4.

Students should ensure that their devices are charged and they have a backup internet hotspot in case of power cuts. The Placement Unit will not be responsible in case such a situation arises.

04/08/23, 12:18 - sreenath: Thanks

04/08/23, 12:25 - Shlok Bits: Superset pe it was open for all
04/08/23, 12:25 - Sandya Bits: Yes because at that time they didn't mention any CG criteria to us
04/08/23, 12:26 - Shubham Pathak Bits: Can’t recall. But Akanksha ( the presenter during pre placement talk ) did mention that she already had a talk with the PU @ Goa…
04/08/23, 12:26 - Madhu Bits: In PPT she said that it was communicated earlier
We can't ask her when this is communicated and all 
I don't think that will be appropriate to ask
04/08/23, 12:26 - Jehan Bits: Yes she said so
04/08/23, 12:27 - Shlok Bits: Yes
04/08/23, 12:27 - Sandya Bits: I don't know about that since Akansha has been speaking with Mouli Sir 
But she didn't put any CG criteria in the beginning, that's for sure
04/08/23, 12:27 - Madhu Bits: Ok 👍🏻
04/08/23, 12:32 - Ravi Bits: so now can we give test as we are eligible as per superset and it will be a practice
or we dont give bcz we know they will not take?
04/08/23, 13:23 - Sandya Bits: We are still trying to talk to her to bring down the CG criteria
04/08/23, 13:24 - Sandya Bits: Only the applicable ones will be able to give the test

We'll be having the second and final distribution of CSIS merchandise *today (Thursday 17th August 2023).*
This will be a distribution for *Oversized Tee* and *Hoodie ONLY*. 

*NOTE:* You may collect your friends' merchandise if they are not available. Their ID card isn't required, only a BITS ID for verification, preferred both.

*Students not on campus can ask someone to collect temporarily for you and collect later since it may not be feasible to access the merch during the short duration of convocation.*

For GIRLS, you can text your IDs to *Yash Khanna (9958743212)* beforehand and we will try to keep it ready before you come outside the CH1 gate. Members of the distribution team will be coming out at intervals to hand over the merch.

Location: *CH1 Common Room*
Time: *9:30 - 11:00 PM*


For any queries, kindly contact:
Piyush Mohite (99707 30967)
Yash Khanna (9958743212)

11/10/23, 06:45 - Hari Bits: Dear Students,

On behalf of the CSIS department, and the faculty committee led by our HoD, invite you who would be interested in, and motivated to participate in the yearlong celebrations of the 20th anniversary of the K.K. Birla Goa Campus of the BITS Pilani.

Kindly respond with your details if interested in being a member of the student committee, by filling out the following form:

*https://forms.gle/VwEBxvCHJszo5EQE7*

To start with - we need to discuss and plan for the upcoming open day to be conducted on the 5th and 6th of November.
Once we have the names - we will meet up (i.e. the faculty committee, and student committee) - on the 16th October Monday (after midsems).

Note that the student committee will also consist of ME and PhD students. So the load will be shared- and it will be a collective effort rather than overloading a select few.

Deadline: *Wednesday (11 October) Evening.*

09/12/23, 08:43 - Shubham Pathak Bits: Hey everyone 👋

The semester has almost come to an end, and we haven’t really gotten time to interact with our batch as a whole, as well as the next batch. Thus, we’re planning a simple gathering ( sort of an unofficial freshers ) on 13th of this month at the VGH lawns. Contribution per person : approx. Rs. 350-400. Before that, kindly let us know your opinion regarding the same by answering the poll below 👇
09/12/23, 08:44 - Shubham Pathak Bits: POLL:
Willing to contribute and attend the freshers

09/12/23, 22:30 - Hussain Bits: Dekhle 11 ya 15 ho sakta ho to
10/12/23, 12:14 - Shubham Pathak Bits: Hello everyone.

After talks with the vgh guys ,the price ( 350 ) seems to be falling short. And looking at these responses, I feel that that most of the class seems uninterested. With less participation and lone responsibility of organizing an event as such, just doesn’t seem possible, financially or otherwise. *Thus I’ve decided not to go forward with the plan* 

Thanks everyone for answering the polls ✌️
